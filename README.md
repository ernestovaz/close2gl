# Close2GL
Reimplementation of OpenGL functionalities in a rendering engine, **made while attending INF01009**. 
Images are rendered entirely in CPU and displayed through passthrough shaders in OpenGL. 

Includes real-time menu made with [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

### Functionalities
* Custom primitive selection (polygons, lines or points)
* Flat and Gouraud shading
* Texture mapping (with bilinear and trilinear filtering)
* Genneraly, most of the time, performs at approximately real-time speed!
